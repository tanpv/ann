Done
	- explain in detail how ann work
		- gradient descent on one and 2 variables
		- ann structure
		- feed forward
		- back propagate delta
		- gradient of cost respect to weight and bias
		- update weight and bias

	- build from scratch a ann with numpy
		- loading data in to numpy array
		- ann in matrix form
		- coding each above steps

	- working with iris dataset
		- understand dataset
		- load dataset

	- working with mnist dataset
		- understand dataset
		- load dataset

	- short cut for jupyter notebook

	- fastai lib
		-

- practical deep learning with pytorch



deep learning from scratch
	- theory
		- gradient descent to find minimum of 1 variable function
		- gradient descent to find mininum of 2 variable function
		
	- practical with python
